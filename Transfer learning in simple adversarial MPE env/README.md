# Adversarial-MATL on a simple adversarial environment

Here, I am initially training 2  good agents and an adversary agent in the simple adversary environment of the pettingzoo, by using duelling double DQN algorithm. Later,  on a similar environment with 3 good agents, transfer learning is implimented on 2 of the 3 good agents and the adversary while the remaining agent is learnt from scratch.
