# Adversarial-MATL
#### Research Project
This project is to enable transfer learning for an adversarial multi agent system. To be more specific, adversarial agents, belonging to opposing objectives are being trained to act against each other to maximise their rewards, in a source environment. The learned lessons are transferred to the target environment to ease up the learning process of these two networks there.
