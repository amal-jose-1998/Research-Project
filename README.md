# Adversarial-MATL
#### Research Project
This project is to enable transfer learning for an adversarial multi agent system. To be more specific, two adversarial agents, red and blue, are being trained to cause and avert faults, respectively, in a Dynamic Fault Tree (DFT) environment. The learned lessons are transferred to the next environment to ease up the learning process of these two networks there.
