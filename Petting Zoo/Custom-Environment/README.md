A test environemnt to get familiarised with pettingzoo

Here i am creating a two-player game consisting of a prisoner, trying to escape, and a guard, trying to catch the prisoner. This game will be played on a 7x7 grid, where:

The prisoner starts in the top left corner,

The guard starts in the bottom right corner,

The escape door is randomly placed in the middle of the grid

Both the prisoner and the guard can move in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).
